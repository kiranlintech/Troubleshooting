# Making passwordless ssh between ec2instance and gitlab

Generate SSH Key (if you haven't already): If you haven't already generated an SSH key, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"   # Replace "your_email@example.com" with your actual email address.

Add SSH Key to SSH Agent: After generating your SSH key, you'll need to add it to the SSH agent. Run the following command:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Make sure you replace ~/.ssh/id_rsa with the actual path to your SSH private key if it's different.

Add SSH Key to Your GitLab Account: Now, you need to add the public key (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) to your GitLab account. You can do this by copying the contents of the public key file and adding it in your GitLab account settings. Here are the general steps:

a. Copy the contents of your public key:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
b. Log in to your GitLab account.
c. Go to your GitLab settings.
d. Navigate to the "SSH Keys" section.
e. Add a new SSH key and paste the contents of your public key into the provided field.

Retry the Clone Command: After adding your SSH key to your GitLab account, you should be able to clone the repository again:

git clone git@gitlab.com:bharathbeeky/bookbatterywars.git
This should resolve the "Permission denied (publickey)" error and allow you to clone the GitLab repository using SSH. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions for the repository you are trying to access.
